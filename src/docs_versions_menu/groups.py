    Args:
        folders (list[str]): List of folder names, corresponding to git branch
            names or tag names compatible with PEP440
        default_branches (list[str] or None): List of eligible branch names for
            the project's default branch. If None, equivalent to
            ``['master', 'main']``

    Returns a dict `groups` with the following group names as keys: and a set
    of folder names for each group as values:

    * 'local-releases': anything that has a "local version part" according to
      PEP440 (e.g. "+dev" suffix)
    * 'dev-releases': any `folders` whose name PEP440 considers a development
      release ("-dev[N]" suffix)
    * 'pre-releases': any `folders` whose name PEP440 considers a pre-release
      (suffixes like '-rc1', '-a1', etc.). This includes dev-releases.
    * 'post-releases': any `folders` whose name PEP440 recognizes as a
      post-release ("-post[N]" suffix)
    * 'final-releases': any `folders` containing only of a release segment (no
      local-, dev-, pre-, or post-releases)
    * 'public-releases': combination of final-releases and post-releases
    * 'default-branch': set containing all existing folders from
      `default_branches`. This *should* contain only a single element.
    * 'branches': Any folder that PEP400 does not recognize as a release
      (including `default_branch`)
    * 'releases': Any folder that PEP400 recognizes as a release
    * 'all': Set of all folders
