# Releases work as follows (driven by ./scripts/release.py):
#
# 1. A non-tagged version with a relase `__version__` (anything not ending in
#    `+dev` or `-dev`) is pushed to a `relase-*` branch. This commit should
#    trigger a release to Test-PyPI, in this workflow.
#
# 2. Once the workflows for the release commit pass, the commit is tagged as
#    `v<__version__>` and the tag is pushed to Github. This triggers the
#    automatic creation of an official "Release" on Github, and this workflow
#    to release to the regular PyPI
#
# For non-releases, this workflow simply ensures that the distribution packages
# are well-formed
